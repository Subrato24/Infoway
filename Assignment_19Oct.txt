1.Create one superclass Hillstations and three subclasses Manali, Mussoorie, Gulmarg. Subclasses extend the superclass and override its location() and famousfor() method.call the location() and famousfor() method by the Parent class’, i.e. Hillstations class. invoke the base class method at runtime.

2. Consider a parent class as living thing.
Living things exist on the planet in the forms of human beings, animals, plants, bacteria, etc. These are the child classes inherited from the parent class, i.e., living things.invoke the base class method at runtime.

3. A class called Author is designed as shown in the class diagram. It contains:
Three private member variables: name (String), email (String), and gender (char of either 'm' or 'f' - you might also use a boolean variable called isMale having value of true or false).
A constructor to initialize the name, email and gender with the given values.
(There is no default constructor, as there is no default value for name, email and gender.)
Public getters/setters: getName(), getEmail(), setEmail(), and getGender().
(There are no setters for name and gender, as these properties are not designed to be changed.). Invoke all base class methods.

4. Human.java class has variables height , weight and bmi which are private.For each variable, there is a setter and getter.Encapsulate the class and obtain output.

public class PolymorphicAssignment
{
 public static void main(String [] args)
 {
 ClassA obj1 = new ClassA();
 ClassA obj2 = new ClassA();
 ClassB obj3 = new ClassB();
1) obj1 = obj2; // no problem here...same data types
2) obj1 = obj3; // obj3 is a type of ClassA…ok
3) //obj3 = obj2; // "incompatible types" compile message
4) //obj3 = obj1; // still incompatible as the obj3 value
 // stored in obj1 (see line 2 above)
 // has lost its ClassB identity
5) obj3 = (ClassB)obj1; // the ClassB identity of the object
 // referenced by obj1 has been retrieved!
 // This is called "downcasting"
6) obj3 = (ClassB)obj2; // This compiles but will not run.
 // ClassCastException run time error
 // Unlike obj1 the obj2 object ref. variable
 // never was a ClassB object to begin with

 } // end main
}// end class 


Idetify errors in above program.
1.What is wrong with the code in lines 3 and 4 above?
2. Why isn’t line 4 okay? From line 2 aren’t you assigning a ClassB value to a ClassB variable?
3. Lines 5 and 6 are syntactically equivalent. They both compile but line 6 will not execute. Why? Explain
the difference between those two lines.
